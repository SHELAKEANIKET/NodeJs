What is node js?
=> NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime environment.
=> with the help of these we can execute the JavaScript programs outside the browser.
=> It is developed by integrating chrome's V8 engine with C++ language.

------------------------------
HTTP Methods
=> GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE
1. GET => when you want to get some data from the server.
2. POST => when you want to sent and mutate some data in server.

------------------------------
Versioning =>
express latest version (inside package.json()) => ^4.18.3

Three parts of 4.18.3: 
part 1 = 4
part 2 = 18
part 3 = 3

// 3rd part (last part) : Minor Fixes (optional) => latest : 3
// 2nd part : Recommended Bug Fix (Security Fix) => latest : 18
// 1st part : Major Release (Major or Breaking Update) => latest : 4

// ^ => Install all the Recommended and Minor Fixes Automatically (Not 1st Part)
// ~ => Install all the Minor Fixes Automatically (Not 1st & 2nd Part)

------------------------------
RESTful API :
=> REST defines a consistent and uniform interface for interactions between clients and servers. For example, the HTTP-based REST APIs make use of the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and the URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources.

------------------------------

HTTP Headers :
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.

best practice :
when we create the custom header then this should be start with X-'headerName', that denotes this is custom header.

------------------------------
* Interview *
Difference between PUT and PATCH methods => 
 - both HTTP methods are used to modify (change) the existing data.
 - PUT method updates the data without including the existing remaining part which we doesn't want to update. (delete the remaining data)
 - PATCH method updates the data & includes the remaining data which we doesn't want to update. (doesn't delete the remaining data)
